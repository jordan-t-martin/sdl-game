# Target Practice!
Shoot all the targets to win! Aim your shots between the rocks to hit the targets. Move around to get the best angles. The goal is to destroy all the targets in the fastest time. After you win, you can choose to play another game or exit.
## Controls
Shoot - Click and hold<br/>
Pause - P<br/>
Move Up - W<br/>
Move Left - A<br/>
Move Down - S<br/>
Move Right - D<br/>
Quit - ESC<br/>

## Tips
You cannot shoot and run at the same time. Try to line up an angle to hit the most targets at once.
